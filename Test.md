# Testing Rodes

Run :
pip install -r requirements.txt

To test, Run:
1) RIPR_B\RIPR_B_training.py
    Used Dev's release of Ridership data as well as weather data

2) run_rodes.py
    Used as input ridr_a\mlr_output_2021_11_19.npy and dataset_generator\stopwithZones as input.
    (I think the routes are too few now, let me know what you guys think)

3) visualizeRoutes.py
    Gives an html file to visualize routes
